# RGraph_minimum_dose_route
## Methods of minimizing doses incurred by external exposure while moving in radiation hazardous areas.

<h3> 1. interpolation.R </h3><br>
Use this code to create a grid from a data file with measurements of ambient dose rate equivalent.

<h3>2. Route_finder_from_A_to_B.R </h3><br>
Use this code to find a route with a minimum dose between two points on the map

<h3>3. Hamiltonian_path_(optimal_bypass_of_selected_points).R</h3><br>
Use this code to find an optimal bypass of selected points on the map (by default for 7 points)

<h3>4. Chinese_postman_problem.R</h3><br>
Use this code to find a solution of a Chinese postman problem. 
The Chinese postman problem is to find a shortest closed path or circuit that visits every edge of a (connected) undirected graph.
By default route starts in edge 1.
